Selection sort treats the input as a sorted part and an usorted part, and repeatedly selects the proper next value to move
from the unsorted part to the end of the sorted part.

## Complexity
The runtime of Selection Sort does not change depending on input.
### Best Case
elements are already sorted
O(n^2)  
Ω(n^2)  
Θ(n^2)  
### Worst Case
O(n^2)  
Ω(n^2)  
Θ(n^2)
